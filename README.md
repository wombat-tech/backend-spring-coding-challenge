# Spielworks Spring backend coding challenge

This is a skeleton for the Spielworks backend coding challenge. It already provides the required
database (using H2) and jOOQ generation (using the nu.studer Gradle plugin). For everything else,
refer to the provided challenge documentation.

# Database

The JDBC URL to reach the database is `jdbc:h2:file:./db/main` (working directory must be the root
of this repository).
